The purpose of the rotation is not to pull deep underwater but instead to allow the arm to the farthest above the head for the catch.</p> <p>The arms should NOT be straight during the pull. Analogous to the recovery of freestyle, the arms are bent underwater. The arms bend after the catch, and the water pushed to the side and then below the swimmer. Straights should be avoided as it can lead to shoulder damage.</p> <p></p> <p>Notice both arms are opposite of each other: as one is pulling, the other is recovering; as one enters the water, the other exits. Doing this is critical to provide constant movement.</p> <p>In addition, the hands rotate about the arm while recovering. The thumb should be the first to surface, and the pinkie should be the first to submerge. This rotation requires a straight arm moving from the swimmers side to above their head.</p> <p></p> <p>Like freestyle, backstroke uses a strong and fast flutter kick. Kicks starting from the hip with pointed feet and a slight bend in the knee provides constant forward progress.</p> <p>Although the swimmer is on their back and has ample time to breath, rhythmic breathing is still necessary to keep endurance. When the breaths occur is up to the swimmer.

Beginner swimmers will introduce a small scissor kick instead of a whip kick; this is not allowed. This typically happens either when the torso rotates slightly, as if doing a flutter kick, or when the feet do not point directly outwards in each direction. Going too fast stroke could also cause a scissor kick when the swimmer is still developing.
