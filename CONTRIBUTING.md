## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://tylerh111.github.io/swimdex).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/tylerh111/swimdex/issues) that might help you.
In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.
It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tylerh111/swimdex/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you are running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report.
Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Thoroughly check the [documentation](https://swimdex.github.com/) for any information you might have missed.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/tylerh111/swimdexissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Check the internet for extra information that backs up your claims.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors.
If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/tylerh111/swimdex/issues/new).
  Since we cannot be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.
- Explain what you believe should be said or explained.
- Please provide as much context as possible
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it is filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will being to investigate the issue and mark it as appropriate.
- Once investigated and deemed necessary to fix, the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Swimdex, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing documentation**.
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Thoroughly check the [documentation](https://tylerh111.github.io/swimdex) for any information you might have missed.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/tylerh111/swimdex/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
  If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
  It is up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this enhancement.
  Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.
  We will still consider adding information based on the minority of our users' needs.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [issues](https://github.com/tylerh111/swimdex/issues).

- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** with as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current information available** and **explain why it mihgt need to be changed**.
  At this point, you can also suggest different alternatives that could mitigate the issue.
- You may want to **include screenshots** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most swimdex users.
  You may also want to point out other projects that provide the information in a better way and which could serve as inspiration.
