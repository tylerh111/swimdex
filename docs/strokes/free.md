Freestyle is the most common swimming stroke in which competitors are subject to only a few limited restrictions.
Frontstroke (front crawl) is used to swim freestyle as it is, typically, the fastest swim stroke.
Freestyle is often a synonym for frontstroke.

## **Tips**

Freestyle uses flutter kick and alternating arm pulls to propel forward.
Swimmers breath to the side while one are is recovering.
Rhythmic breathing should be applied by only breathing every odd number of strokes, typically every 3 or 5 strokes.

The best freestyle form has a strong and fast kick and a long reaching pull.
Reaching to the furthest point during the recovery followed by a small glide at the end provides balance.
Each pull should rotate the body enough to allow for a deep mid-pull and a strong finish.
Kicks starting from the hip with pointed feet and a slight bend in the knee provides constant forward progress.

The following is a chart of skills that will enhance a swimmers freestyle.
